def edit_preset(preset_path: str, spec: PresetSpec) -> str:
    """Apply a partial ``spec`` update to an existing preset, in place.

    Only the sections/indices present in ``spec`` are touched -- e.g. an
    edit that only sets ``filters=[...]`` leaves oscillators, envelopes,
    macros, FX and mod routes exactly as they were. Within a section, only
    the fields that differ from the preset's current values are written, so
    an entry resubmitted unchanged (to keep a later entry's list position)
    leaves its data -- embedded wavetables, FX sub-data, mod curves, LFO
    shape names -- exactly as it was. ``spec.description``
    updates the preset's metadata only if non-empty.

    If ``spec.name`` differs from the preset's current name, the file is
    renamed to match (Serum's own preset browser displays the filename, not
    the internal ``presetName`` metadata -- confirmed against a live Serum
    2 install, editing metadata alone left the displayed name unchanged).
    The old file is removed once the renamed one is written successfully.

    Returns the absolute path of the edited file -- the new path if the
    preset was renamed, otherwise the same as ``preset_path`` -- as the
    FIRST LINE of the return value, always. If ``spec`` used
    ``custom_harmonics``/``sample_source``/``sample_playback_source``/
    ``granular_source``/``spectral_source``, additional lines list the
    local file(s) that preset now depends on -- see
    ``generate_preset``'s docstring / ``tools/_dependencies.py`` for why.
