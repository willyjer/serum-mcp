"""The semantic, MCP-client-facing preset schema.

This is deliberately a *simplified* view of the full raw parameter set in
:mod:`serum_mcp.preset.schema` -- friendly field names, a curated filter-type
vocabulary, seconds instead of opaque curve values where we're confident of
the unit. The calling model (see ``server.py``'s tool instructions) builds
JSON matching :class:`PresetSpec` itself; :mod:`serum_mcp.preset.mapping`
then translates a validated ``PresetSpec`` onto the raw CBOR structure.

Every field range mirrors the bounds recorded in ``preset/schema.py`` --
if you change one, change the other.

    in ``preset.schema.MOD_DEST_TARGETS`` (oscillator volume/pan/octave/
    pitch/fine, filter cutoff/resonance/drive, envelope attack/decay/
    sustain/release). ``velocity`` is a good fit for envelope attack/decay/
    release (classic velocity-sensitivity) or filter cutoff (velocity-
    sensitive brightness); ``key_track`` for filter cutoff that opens up on
    higher notes; ``aftertouch``/``poly_aftertouch`` for post-note-on
    expressive control (e.g. pressure adding vibrato or opening the filter);
    ``random1``/``random2``/``random_discrete`` for per-note humanization
    (e.g. small pan or pitch variation); ``release_velo``/``voice_mod1``/
    ``voice_mod2``/``active_voices``/``voice_index`` exact musical meaning
    unconfirmed beyond their Serum UI name (only their source IDs were
    probed, not their live behavior) -- all IDs confirmed live 2026-07-29
    via direct probing of a real Serum 2 instance. ``fixed`` is Serum's own
    MATRIX-tab name for a CONSTANT modulation offset -- ``amount`` alone,
    with no time-varying signal at all, useful for a permanent bias on a
    destination (e.g. a fixed pitch/tuning offset) without dedicating an LFO
    or macro to it.

    Resolved 2026-08-01, closing nearly the entire remaining source list:
    ``note_on_alt``/``note_on_alt2`` (Note category, meaning unconfirmed
    beyond the UI name, same caveat as ``voice_mod1``/``2``);
    ``expr_pan``/``expr_timbre``/``expr_press`` (MPE-style per-note note
    expression -- ``mod_wheel``/``aftertouch``-style continuous control,
    only meaningful with an MPE-capable controller/DAW routing); and 7
    SELF-MODULATION sources -- ``oscillator0``..``oscillator4`` (that
    oscillator SLOT's own audio-rate output, same 0-indexed convention as
    the destination side: 0/1/2/3/4 = Osc A/B/C/Noise/Sub) and
    ``filter0``/``filter1`` (that filter's own audio-rate output) -- a
    module using its own signal to modulate something else, distinct from
    routing something INTO that module. Live audible behavior of the
    self-modulation and note-expression sources not yet independently
    tested, same "IDs confirmed, behavior not" caveat as the Note-category
    sources above.

    ``lfo1_y`` (id 40, resolved 2026-08-01) closes the last of this
    project's originally-flagged unknown source ids -- presumed to be the
    Y-axis/secondary coordinate output of LFO slot 2 (``lfo1``) when using
    a chaotic-attractor shape (Rossler/Lorenz), distinct from that LFO's
    own primary output. Confirmed for this ONE specific slot only, by
    reading a real Factory preset's own MATRIX tab directly -- whether
    other LFO slots have an analogous ``_y`` source, and what id it would
    use, is unknown; don't assume a contiguous family exists.

    ``aux_source``/``aux_inverted`` expose Serum's general "Aux"/"Via"
    system: an OPTIONAL second, independent source (same vocabulary as
    ``source``, including ``fixed``) that scales/gates how much of
    ``amount`` actually reaches ``destination``. Decoded 2026-07-30 via a
    626-preset corpus survey: 1276 real routes across nearly every source
    family use this, by far most commonly ``mod_wheel`` or ``aftertouch`` as
    the aux (e.g. "LFO1 -> pitch" scaled by the mod wheel, a classic
    controllable-vibrato pattern -- turn the wheel up to bring in an
    already-configured LFO depth rather than routing the wheel directly to
    pitch). Originally found narrowly on ``fixed`` routes and assumed to be
    a `fixed`-only mechanism; the survey showed that was just the first
    example encountered, not the whole feature. ``aux_inverted`` (rare, 2.8%
    of aux-paired routes, always literally "on" when present) flips the aux
    source before it scales ``amount``. **Combination formula confirmed
    2026-07-31** via automated audio-rendering measurement (see
    docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md item 14): ``effective_amount = amount *
    (aux_value / 100)``, or with ``aux_inverted=True``, ``effective_amount =
    amount * (1 - aux_value / 100)`` -- a clean linear percentage scale,
    verified by sweeping an aux macro's own value 0/25/50/75/100 and
    measuring the resulting filter cutoff shift. A rarer curve-shaping param
    (``kParamAuxCurve``) exists but is basically never used in real content
    (0.16% of aux-paired routes) and isn't exposed here -- the linear
    formula above is what applies whenever it's absent, i.e. essentially
    always.

    panel (RANDOM/SEQ columns, PAN/DETUNE/CUTOFF/ENVS/MOD1/MOD2 rows, an
    8-bar chart, one bar per unison voice). Decoded 2026-08-05 via a
    ground-truth test: the user typed '-20' directly into a real Serum
    instance's PAN bar for voice 6 and saved, and the raw
    ``VoicePanel0.kParamVoice6Pan`` Serum itself wrote back was
    ``-20.259740948677063``.

    That, cross-checked against 47 other real values from a genuine Galaxy
    preset, confirmed: **every per-voice value here is simply a percentage,
    stored ~1:1 with the displayed number** (Serum quantizes internally to
    steps of ``10/77 ~= 0.12987`` -- confirmed EVERY real per-voice value
    sampled is an exact integer multiple of that step -- but this is far
    finer than the display resolution and doesn't need to be replicated;
    just write the plain percentage). Negative = Left / positive = Right
    for ``pan`` specifically (confirmed by the '-20' -> '-20L' display).
    The exact bipolar-vs-unipolar range for each OTHER field
    (``detune``/``filter_cutoff``/``env_time``/``mod1``/``mod2``) is NOT
    independently confirmed the same way -- real Galaxy data included both
    signs for most of them (``mod1`` hit exactly -100/+100, suggesting a
    genuine -100..100 range), so -100..100 is used as a permissive common
    bound, not a confirmed per-field range.

    This is now the ONLY model for ``VoicePanel0`` (the earlier opaque
    ``PresetSpec.voice_panel`` dict was removed 2026-08-05 once every real
    key found across the full corpus -- including the 2 global scaling
    params, whose exact 1:1 percentage relationship was confirmed the same
    day via the SAME '-20' ground-truth technique applied to the SCALING
    row -- got a friendly home here). Like every other module in this
    codebase, writing these fields MERGES onto ``VoicePanel0.plainParams``
    (via ``_plain_params``) rather than replacing it wholesale, so editing
    a preset that already has other/unknown ``VoicePanel0`` keys leaves
    them untouched.

    Each list entry can be ``None`` for a voice that doesn't set this
    param at all (vs. ``0.0``, a real explicit value) -- found live
    round-tripping a real preset where ``kParamVoice2EnvTime`` was
    genuinely ABSENT (voice 2 alone, surrounded by voices that DID set
    it): matches this project's established "presence forces the DSP
    stage" pattern everywhere else in the codebase, so a genuine gap must
    round-trip as a gap, not get silently coerced to a real 0.0 value.
