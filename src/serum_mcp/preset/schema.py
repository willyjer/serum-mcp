"""Ground-truth schema for the Serum 2 CBOR parameter payload.

Nothing here is guessed. Every bound, default and enum value was either:

- **measured** empirically, by unpacking ~300 factory presets shipped with a
  real Serum 2 install (see ``docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md`` for the sampling
  methodology) and recording observed min/max/values per ``kParam*`` key, or
- **confirmed authoritative**, by cross-referencing against a JSON dump of
  every VST3 parameter (with its default value) reported by a freshly loaded
  Serum 2 instance
  (https://gist.github.com/KennethWussmann/5b58e4de728680a0bf8906a8b113103d).

Where those two sources disagree, or where a parameter was only rarely
observed, that is called out in the ``notes`` field rather than silently
picking one. This schema intentionally covers the subset of Serum 2's engine
that matters for *sound design from a text description* (oscillators,
filters, envelopes, LFOs, macros, the mod matrix, and the effects chain) --
it does not attempt to model the arpeggiator/sequencer, MPE, MIDI clips or
GUI state, which round-trip through :mod:`serum_mcp.preset.packer` untouched
but are not validated or generated.

    engine (slots 0-2, ``OscillatorSpec.multisample_source``) -- decoded
    2026-07-31. Unlike ``WavetableDef``/``SampleAudioDef`` (a single audio
    file's metadata), MultiSampleOsc's real structure is a full SFZ-format
    keyzone mapping across MANY sample files, too complex to synthesize from
    scratch this round (see docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md item 3) -- so, mirroring
    how ``wavetable``/``sample_source`` reference curated Factory content
    rather than building a wavetable from arbitrary user data, this
    references an EXISTING real Factory instrument's structure verbatim.

    Confirmed live 2026-07-31: `embedded_sfz` and `files` are BYTE-IDENTICAL
    across every real preset observed referencing the same instrument (e.g.
    4 different presets all using ``Factory/Choir/Ah High.sfz`` produced
    identical CBOR for both fields) -- only each preset's own `plainParams`
    (envelope/warp) differ. This means it's safe to hard-code these two
    fields once per instrument and let `plainParams` stay freely settable,
    the same trust level as any other curated Factory reference in this
    project.

    `files`' own keys use a literal backslash as path separator, but the
    exact COUNT is not universal -- corrected 2026-08-01 after curating 6
    more instruments: `choir_ah`/`guitar_ac` genuinely use a literal DOUBLE
    backslash (confirmed by inspecting individual characters, e.g.
    ``"Choir Samples\\\\XFChoir Ah High A#2.flac"``, not a transcription
    artifact), but `violins` (already in this dict beforehand) and all 6
    newly-curated instruments use a single backslash instead -- a real,
    per-instrument authoring inconsistency on Xfer's own side (plausibly
    different sample-prep tooling/versions across their content library),
    not a bug in this project. Always preserve exactly what a fresh
    extraction produces; never assume/normalize the separator count.

# GranularOsc (slots 0-2, an alternate engine selected via kParamType=
# "kOsc_Granular" the same way kOsc_Sample/kOsc_WT are, see mapping.py's
# oscillator loop) -- surveyed and its full automatable/private param enum
# mined from the VST3 binary's own debug strings 2026-07-30 (same technique
# used throughout this project): 22 automatable params (kParamWarp/
# WarpVar/WarpMenu/Warp2/WarpVar2/WarpMenu2 -- shared with WTOsc/SampleOsc's
# own warp system -- plus kParamDensity/GrainLength/GrainReverse/
# WindowParam/WindowSkew/WindowShape/RandomOffset/RandomDir/RandomPitch/
# RandomGrainLength/RandomPan/RandomGain/RandomWindowAmount/
# RandomWindowSkew/RandomWarp/RandomWarp2) plus 7 private ones
# (kParamLengthMode/DensityMode/MaxNumGrains/YAxisAssignment/
# UnisonTrigPattern/JumpStartGrains/DensityDotted/DensityTriplet/
# LengthDotted/LengthTriplet/LoopGrains/LengthKeyTrack -- some genuinely
# rarely used, see per-param confidence/notes below). Only the 5 highest-
# presence controls (found via a 66-sample corpus survey) plus warp_amount/
# warp_mode (shared OscillatorSpec fields, already used by WTOsc/SampleOsc)
# are wired into OscillatorSpec/mapping.py/introspect.py this round --
# window shaping, randomization-direction/gain/window-skew, BPM-synced
# density/length, unison trigger pattern, and the granular-specific warp
# lane 2 remain documented here (round-trip/edit safety via
# `_plain_params`'s allow_unknown merge) but not independently generatable.
# CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-07-30 in real Serum 2 after fixing the two
# raw<->displayed conversion bugs documented immediately below -- a
# generated GranularOsc genuinely produces a grain-cloud texture,
# cross-validated by ear against a real Factory Granular preset
# (`808 - Texture`). A SCAN/playback-position system (`kParamScanRate`/
# `kParamPosition`, on the OUTER `Oscillator{i}` container, not this table)
# was found live but remains unwired -- see docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md item 3.
#
# kParamDensity/kParamGrainLength's raw<->UI-displayed relationships --
# decoded live 2026-07-30 after the FIRST real-Serum test of GranularOsc
# came back broken ("plays like a sample, extremely filtered"). Root cause:
# both params were being written as if OscillatorSpec's value WAS the raw
# CBOR value directly (matching every other already-modeled param in this
# project), but neither actually is -- confirmed by asking the user to type
# exact DENS/LENGTH-knob values into a real Serum 2 instance and reading
# back the resulting saved file's raw value for each:
#   - kParamDensity: raw = displayed**4 / 810 (a clean QUARTIC curve,
#     confirmed EXACT across 3 points: displayed 5/15/25 -> raw
#     0.7716/62.5/482.25). The knob's own confirmed display range is 0-30;
#     30**4/810 == 1000 exactly, a suspiciously round number strongly
#     suggesting 1000 is the true raw ceiling -- NOT the 850ish this
#     project had previously guessed purely from corpus min/max
#     observations (which was simply wrong, an artifact of never having
#     confirmed the curve shape).
#   - kParamGrainLength: raw = displayed / 1000 (LINEAR, confirmed exact
#     across displayed 0.05/0.3/1.0 -> raw 0.00005/0.0003/0.001). The
#     original bug in one sentence: writing OscillatorSpec.
#     granular_grain_length=0.15 (intended as "0.15 seconds") directly as
#     the raw value actually displays as 150 in Serum's own UI -- an
#     absurdly long, almost certainly clamped grain length that made the
#     engine effectively play large continuous chunks of the source
#     instead of short grains, the direct cause of "plays like a sample."
# OscillatorSpec.granular_density/granular_grain_length are the UI-
# displayed numbers (what a user would type into Serum), NOT the raw CBOR
# values -- mapping.py/introspect.py apply these conversions at the
# read/write boundary so PresetSpec stays in the same "matches what you'd
# see in Serum's own UI" convention as every other already-modeled param.

# MultiSampleOsc (slots 0-2, alternate engine kParamType="kOsc_MultiSample")
# -- decoded 2026-07-31 via a 246-sample corpus survey. Unlike SampleOsc/
# GranularOsc/SpectralOsc (a single audio file reference), MultiSampleOsc's
# real structure is a full SFZ-format multisample keyzone mapping across
# MANY sample files (embedded_sfz text + a files metadata dict, see
# MultiSampleInstrumentDef above) -- too complex to synthesize a NEW
# instrument from scratch this round, so only a curated set of real Factory
# instruments (MULTISAMPLE_INSTRUMENTS) are referenceable, mirroring
# `wavetable`'s curated-Factory-content approach. This table only covers
# MultiSampleOsc's own `plainParams` (its OSC-level envelope/warp controls,
# layered on top of whatever ADSR the SFZ's own regions define -- these are
# NOT the primary voice envelope, Env0-3). Only the 3 highest-presence
# controls (kParamEnvAttack 98%, kParamEnvRelease 100%, kParamEnvDecay 97%)
# plus warp_amount/warp_mode (shared with every other warp-capable engine)
# are wired into OscillatorSpec this round; kParamEnvOverride/
# VelTrackOverride/TimbreShift/RandomPhase/VelTrack/second warp lane remain
# documented here for round-trip/edit safety only.

# (sine/triangle/square/saw/etc) are stored purely as curve points, not a
# named type, and decoding that point format is out of scope for now.
# `curveVals` -- live-Serum-GUI-tested 2026-08-01 (see docs/
# PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md item 4 for the full writeup). CONFIRMED to have a
# real, symmetric-around-0.5 tension effect on 3+ point curves (0.5 =
# exactly linear, 0.2/0.8 bow the same segment in opposite directions --
# qualitatively matching a power-curve hypothesis from researching Vital's
# open-source curve editor), but the exact formula and the on-screen
# point/axis layout aren't nailed down, and a 2-point curve shows NO
# curveVals effect at all (always a straight line). Also found along the
# way: loading a real curveData preset via Serum's own GUI requires
# `curveDisplayName: "Custom"` (+ empty `pathData: {}`) alongside
# `curveData` or Serum ignores it silently; and 2-point curves with
# yVals[1] > yVals[0] ("ascending") render as a blank graph -- always use
# yVals[0] > yVals[1] ("descending") for any hand-crafted 2-point curve.
# Not wired into any PresetSpec field yet -- not enough to safely expose a
# "generate a curve" feature without fitting the exact formula first.
#
# `kParamType`, found live 2026-07-29 while diagnosing why a recreated
# preset ("Galaxy") sounded nothing like the real one despite every other
# parameter matching -- the real preset's busiest LFO turned out to be set
# to Sample & Hold, which the UI shows as "S&H" but the raw file calls
# `kParamType: "RandomSH"`. This is DIFFERENT from a hand-drawn curve: it's
# one of a handful of named, purely-algorithmic LFO shapes Serum computes
# procedurally (no curveData needed for most of them), so -- unlike the
# general curve-shape gap above -- these ARE cheaply generatable. Surveyed
# across all 886 real .SerumPreset files on this machine: exactly 4 named
# values appear (`Rossler`/363, `Lorenz`/337, `RandomSH`/127, `Path`/36,
# all chaotic-attractor or randomization algorithms -- Rossler/Lorenz are
# genuine strange attractors used for organic modulation, "Path" is
# unconfirmed but likely a traced-path oscillator). The key is ABSENT
# (not some other value) in the other ~3500 LFO slots sampled -- 2851 use
# curveData instead (a real hand-drawn or built-in-preset curve), 656 are
# plain/untouched defaults. `default=None` here (not a string) to preserve
# that three-way distinction -- see SIMPLE_LFO_TYPES.

# Serum 2's arpeggiator: a single on/off toggle (`Arp0`) plus 12 pattern
# "clip" slots (`ArpClip0..11`), only one of which is normally used
# (`Arp0.kParamActiveClipID` selects which; almost always absent/0 in real
# content). Reverse-engineered by inspecting all 180 presets in a real
# third-party bank (Unmute's "Places") -- 15 had the arp enabled. An
# unpopulated ArpClip slot has `plainParams: "default"` (same sentinel as
# VoiceFilter/FXRack when untouched) and `clip: {}`.
#
# `kParamShape` (and the separate `kParamTransposeShape`, which modulates
# transposition independently using the *same* enum) selects the pattern
# algorithm. Two DISTINCT modes exist and this project only generates one:
# - Algorithmic (Played, Chord, Converge, RandOnce, RandDrift, RandNoDup,
#   and very likely Up/Down/UpDown/ThumbUp given "Down"/"ThumbUp"/"Diverge"
#   were observed on kParamTransposeShape -- GENERATABLE, see ArpSpec.
# - "Pattern": a real hand-drawn MIDI-clip-like note list lives in this
#   clip's own `clip.notes` array (each note: noteNum/timeStamp/length/
#   channel/an 8-float "attributes" vector whose exact meaning isn't
#   decoded, always identical across every note observed here/expressionEvents).
#   Actually the single MOST COMMON shape in the real sample (9/23 populated
#   clips) -- NOT modeled yet, out of scope for this pass. Selecting
#   shape="pattern" via ArpSpec is rejected with a clear error rather than
#   silently writing an empty/broken pattern.

# Curated subset of the real (larger, per the module comment above) shape
# enum -- only values directly observed in real CBOR data, to avoid writing
# an unconfirmed string Serum might reject or silently reinterpret. Widened
# after a second pass across all 844 real presets available (Factory + 6
# third-party banks, not just the original 180-preset sample) -- turned up
# 6 more confirmed shapes, including UpDown (the 2nd most common value
# overall after Pattern).
#
# UpDown/DownUp/UpAndDown/DownAndUp CONFIRMED 2026-08-05 via the
# serum-verify audio pipeline: a held 3-note chord (C4/E4/G4) through each
# shape, onset-detected step timing + per-segment pitch estimation
# (librosa.pyin) to reconstruct the actual played note sequence. Exactly
# matched the guessed-but-unverified hypothesis in this comment's earlier
# version -- it IS about whether the turnaround note repeats:
#   UpDown:     C E G E C E G E ...  (ascend then descend, extremes NOT repeated, starts ascending)
#   DownUp:     G E C E G E C E ...  (mirror of UpDown -- starts descending)
#   UpAndDown:  C E G G E C C E G G ...  (extremes EACH repeat once at the turnaround, starts ascending)
#   DownAndUp:  G E C C E G G E C C ...  (mirror of UpAndDown -- starts descending)
# i.e. "Down"-first vs "Up"-first sets the starting direction; "And"
# present vs absent sets whether the top/bottom note doubles before
# reversing direction. See docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md's Arpeggiator section
# for the full writeup.

# ModSlot0..ModSlot63: the mod matrix. Structurally confirmed (destModuleID /
# destModuleParamID / destModuleParamName / destModuleTypeString / source /
# plainParams.kParamAmount). destModuleParamID is CONFIRMED per (type, param)
# pair: sampling every ModSlot across all 626 factory presets, each
# (destModuleTypeString, destModuleParamName) pair maps to exactly one
# destModuleParamID with zero conflicting observations for the params we
# target below (see MOD_DEST_TARGETS) -- these numeric IDs also match the
# C++ enum declarations recovered from the plugin binary's debug strings
# (e.g. Oscillator's `kParamEnable=0, kParamVolume, kParamPan, kParamOctave,
# kParamPitch, kParamFine, kParamCoarsePit, ...`), which is independent
# cross-validation, not just internal consistency.
#
# `source: [sourceId, subIndex]` is PARTIALLY decoded. Clustering all 626
# presets' mod routes by source ID revealed two clean, high-confidence
# blocks (see MOD_SOURCE_IDS below): ids 6-15 (LFO1-10) and ids 25-32
# (Macro1-8), each a contiguous run matching Serum 2's known module count,
# with an internally consistent usage/bipolar signature and a
# monotonically-decreasing per-slot usage curve (slot 1 used most, matching
# the "reach for the first knob" convention seen everywhere else in the
# factory content). This was `observed` (statistical clustering only) until
# 2026-07-29, when two rounds of a direct-UI-probe method resolved thirteen
# more IDs: a real Serum 2 instance was used to wire up one route per known
# source by hand (round 1: Note > Velo, Mod Wheel, Pitch Bend, Note > Note#,
# Note > NoteOn Rand1/Rand2/(Discrete), Envelopes > Env 1; round 2:
# Aftertouch, Poly Aftertouch, Envelopes > Env 2/3/4) and the resulting file
# inspected raw each time. Results: Velocity=16, Mod Wheel=1 (resolving the
# earlier id-1-vs-16 ambiguity in favor of Mod Wheel, not Velocity), Env1-4
# as sources=2/3/4/5 (a contiguous block, confirming what was first just a
# guess from Env1 alone), Note#/Key Track=17, Aftertouch=18, Poly
# Aftertouch=19, NoteOn Rand1=21, NoteOn Rand2=22, Pitch Bend=33 (immediately
# after the Macro block), NoteOn Rand (Discrete)=59. All `confirmed`-
# confidence (direct probe, not statistics) -- this closes out every source
# in this project's original gap list (Envelope/Velocity/Mod Wheel/
# Aftertouch/Pitch Bend/Key Track/Random). Remaining unresolved sources
# (`Release Velo`, `Active Voices`, `Voice Index`, `Voice Mod 1`/`2`,
# `Oscillators`/`Filters`/`Note Expression` as self-mod sources) are ones
# this project only learned existed by seeing Serum 2's real source picker --

# See docs/PARAMETER_SCHEMA.md §6 for the full methodology, and

# FXSplit / FXSplit3 / FXSplitMS -- multi-band split/merge FX units, decoded
# 2026-07-30 via a 626-preset corpus survey (77 real occurrences: 43/19/15).
# Despite the "structurally different, needs a recursive FxUnitSpec" note
# this comment used to carry, they turned out to have an ORDINARY flat
# plainParams dict, same as every other FX type -- no nested container at
# all. What actually differs is how the SUBSEQUENT entries in that same
# rack's flat FX list are interpreted:
#   - FXSplit (2 bands): kParamModuleCount1/kParamModuleCount2 (each
#     optional, default/absent = 0) give branch 1's and branch 2's own unit
#     counts. Reading the flat list AFTER the split entry in order: the
#     first kParamModuleCount1 entries belong to band 1 (below kParamFreq),
#     the next kParamModuleCount2 entries belong to band 2 (above
#     kParamFreq) -- confirmed against 43 real examples with ZERO
#     exceptions, e.g. `BA - Dual MG Bass.SerumPreset`
#     (kParamModuleCount1=1, kParamModuleCount2=1, followed by exactly
#     [FXDistortion, FXDelay]: branch1=[FXDistortion], branch2=[FXDelay]).
#   - FXSplit3 (3 bands): same idea with kParamModuleCount1/2/3 and TWO
#     crossover frequencies (kParamFreq = low/mid boundary, kParamFreq2 =
#     mid/high boundary) -- confirmed against 19 real examples, e.g.
#     `KIT - 808 Basic Kit.SerumPreset` (all three counts=1, followed by
#     [FXComp, FXComp, FXComp, FXConv, FXComp]: 3 bands of 1 unit each,
#     then 2 more units continuing AFTER the split/remerge point).
#   - FXSplitMS (Mid/Side split, no crossover frequency -- channel-based,
#     not frequency-based): kParamModuleCount1/kParamModuleCount2 for the
#     Mid and Side branches respectively -- confirmed against 15 real
#     examples, same consumption rule.
# In every type, once all bands' counts are consumed, ANY remaining entries
# in that rack continue as ordinary SERIAL processing on the recombined
# signal (the bands implicitly remerge back into one signal after their own
# branch chains) -- e.g. the `KIT - 808 Basic Kit` example's trailing
# [FXConv, FXComp] process the merged 3-band output further. This needs NO
# special code: it's the exact same flat, ordered `fx_chain` list every
# other FX type already uses -- `FxUnitSpec(type='FXSplit', params={
# 'kParamFreq': ..., 'kParamModuleCount1': ..., 'kParamModuleCount2': ...})`
# followed by that many further `FxUnitSpec` entries in the SAME rack IS a
# correctly-formed split. The calling model is responsible for setting the
# counts to match how many entries it actually places in each band (see
# server.py's fx_chain guidance) -- nothing here validates that a count
# matches reality, the same trust level as every other free-form field.
# None of the three has a `kParamWet`/mix knob (absent from every real
# sample) -- omitted here the same way FXEQ omits it.

# Role starting points -- a condensed, structured transcription of
# docs/SOUND_DESIGN_REFERENCE.md's per-role statistics (derived from
# analyzing all 180 presets in Unmute's "Places For Serum 2" commercial
# bank, broken down by role). Exists so this data reaches the calling model
# via list_parameters() -- a call server.py's guidance already establishes
# as a habitual first step before generating -- instead of depending on the
# model separately deciding to Read a markdown file each session. The full
# prose doc has more qualitative nuance and caveats (sample sizes, "treat as
# anecdotal" warnings for small categories); this is the numeric skeleton
# for quick lookup, not a replacement for it. Ranges are `min..max (median)`
# or a single median where the doc only gives one; times are seconds to
# match EnvelopeSpec's own units. `confidence` here is `observed` for all of
# it -- statistical patterns in one professional bank, not confirmed against
# Xfer documentation.
