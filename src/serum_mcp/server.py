"""MCP server entry point: exposes generate_preset, edit_preset,
list_parameters and describe_preset over stdio for Claude Code / Claude
Desktop / any MCP client.

Sound design happens in the calling model (you), not inside this server:
generate_preset/edit_preset take a structured PresetSpec, not a free-text
description. There is no LLM call anywhere in this package -- translating a
user's natural-language request into a PresetSpec is entirely your job,
guided by the docstrings below and list_parameters()/describe_preset().
This keeps the tool usable from any MCP client's existing model without a
separate, separately-billed API call.

        "back to resolving it as a real file when it's not a curated name -- this existed "
        "for edit_preset round-tripping but was never mentioned as a generation option "
        "before). This unlocks REAL variety, including tables that sound like specific "
